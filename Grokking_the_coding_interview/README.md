# Grokking The Coding Interview

## This Repo And Its Content Discusses major patterns in the coding interview questions.

The content categorizes coding interview problems into a set of 16 patterns

Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems.

The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

Overall, the Folder has around **150** problems mapped to **16 patterns**.

The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.

We will make use of **_Breadth-First Search_** and **_Depth-First Search_** to solve problems related to **_Trees_** and **_Graphs_**. Similarly, we will also cover **_Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Recursion, Greedy algorithms, and Divide & Conquer_**.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping onto the problems. Under each pattern, the first problem will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems.

The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.
