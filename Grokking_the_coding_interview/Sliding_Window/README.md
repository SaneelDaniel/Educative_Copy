# Sliding Window Pattern

## Itroduction

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

For example, take a look at this problem:

> Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.

Let's try to understand the problem with a real input

```javascript
Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], (K = 5);
```

Here, we are asked to find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘5’ in the given array.

Let’s solve this:

> 1. For the first 5 numbers (subarray from index 0-4), the average is: (1+3+2+6−1)/5=>2.2
> 2. The average of next 5 numbers (subarray from index 1-5) is: (3+2+6−1+4)/5=>2.8
> 3. For the next 5 numbers (subarray from index 2-6), the average is: (2+6-1+4+1)/5=>2.4
>    ...

Here is the final output containing the averages of all contiguous subarrays of size 5:

```javascript
Output: [2.2, 2.8, 2.4, 3.6, 2.8];
```

<br/>

### A Brute Force Solution

```
- Calculate the sum of every 5-element contiguous subarray of the given array
- Divide the sum by 5 to find the average
```

```java

import java.util.Arrays;

class AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK {
  public static double[] findAverages(int K, int[] arr) {
    double[] result = new double[arr.length - K + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= arr.length - K; i++) {
      // find sum of next 'K' elements
      double sum = 0;
      for (int j = i; j < i + K; j++)
        sum += arr[j];
      result[i] = sum / K; // calculate average
    }

    return result;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] result = AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK.findAverages(5, new int[] { 1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2 });
    System.out.println("Averages of subarrays of size K: " + Arrays.toString(result));
  }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** Since for every element of the input array, we are calculating the sum of its next ‘K’ elements, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N \* K) where ‘N’ is the number of elements in the input array.

The inefficiency is that for any two consecutive subarrays of size ‘5’, the overlapping part (which will contain four elements) will be evaluated twice.

For example, take the above-mentioned input:

there are four overlapping elements between the subarray (indexed from 0-4) and the subarray (indexed from 1-5).

How can we somehow reuse the sum we have calculated for the overlapping elements?
<br/>

### Efficient Approach

The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each contiguous subarray as a sliding window of ‘5’ elements.

This means that we will slide the window by one element when we move on to the next subarray.

```
To reuse the sum from the previous subarray we will:
 - Subtract the element going out of the window
 - Add the element now being included in the sliding window.
```

This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to O(N).

Here is the algorithm for the Sliding Window approach:
<br/>

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK {
  public static double[] findAverages(int K, int[] arr) {
    double[] result = new double[arr.length - K + 1];
    double windowSum = 0;
    int windowStart = 0;
    for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < arr.length; windowEnd++) {
      windowSum += arr[windowEnd]; // add the next element
      // slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
      if (windowEnd >= K - 1) {
        result[windowStart] = windowSum / K; // calculate the average
        windowSum -= arr[windowStart]; // subtract the element going out
        windowStart++; // slide the window ahead
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] result = AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK.findAverages(5, new int[] { 1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2 });
    System.out.println("Averages of subarrays of size K: " + Arrays.toString(result));
  }
}
```
